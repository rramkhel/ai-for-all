# PLAN.md — Execution Plan

<!--
  This file is generated during planning sessions with Claude Browser.
  Ralph Wiggum works through it top-to-bottom, checking off tasks.

  Rules:
  - Every task is a concrete action with a clear "done" state
  - No decision points — all decisions were made during planning
  - Reference sprint docs for details: "per docs/sprint-X.Y-name.md"
  - Group tasks into phases for readability
  - Each phase ends with a build verification task

  This file is blank in the template. Claude Browser populates it
  for each specific project during the planning session.
