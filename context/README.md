# context/

Persistent project knowledge that Claude Code reads every session. Unlike sprint docs in `docs/` (which are temporary and get archived), these files live for the life of the project.

## What goes here

- **design-system.md** — Colors, fonts, spacing, component patterns
- **site-structure.md** — Page map, navigation, URL structure
- **program-info.md** — Session schedule, dates, curriculum details

## Who creates these files

- **Claude Browser** generates them during planning when relevant
- **Rachel** can add them manually anytime
- **Claude Code** should never modify these without explicit instructions
